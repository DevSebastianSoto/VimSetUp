Plugins

For all the plugins to work, you should also use the .vimrc file provided in
the repository.

Pathogen (installer)

  To install pathogen, if they donâ€™t exist already, create these two directories:

    ~/.vim/autoload/
    ~/.vim/bundle/

  Save https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/master/autoload/pathogen.vim to ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim

  (You don't need this step if using my vimrc file)
  Configure pathogen in your vimrc:

    execute pathogen#infect()
    filetype plugin indent on
    syntax on

lightline.vim (ruler improved)

  git clone https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim ~/.vim/bundle/lightline.vim
